      The story of "fonts and words" refers to the relationship between the
      visual style of typography (fonts) and the content they convey (words).
      Fonts are chosen to complement a story's genre and maintain reader focus
      by minimizing distraction, with serif fonts like Garamond for classic
      novels and sans-serif fonts like Arial for modern designs. The font's
      historical roots trace back to the Old French word "fonte" for a casting
      or mould, highlighting its function in shaping the written word.
