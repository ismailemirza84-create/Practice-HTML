    <p>
      The standard lorem ipsum passage has been a printer's friend for
      centuries. Like stock photos today, it served as a placeholder for actual
      content. The original text comes from Cicero's philosophical work "De
      Finibus Bonorum et Malorum," written in 45 BC. The use of the lorem ipsum
      passage dates back to the 1500s. When printing presses required
      painstaking hand-setting of type, workers needed something to show clients
      how their pages would look. To save time, they turned to Cicero's words,
      creating sample books filled with preset paragraphs. However, it wasn't
      until the 1960s that the passage became common when Letraset
      revolutionized the advertising industry with its transfer sheets. These
      innovative sheets allowed designers to apply pre-printed lorem ipsum text
      in various fonts and formats directly onto their mockups and prototypes.
