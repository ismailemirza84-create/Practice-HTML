    <h1>This is a Grocerry Shop</h1>
    <p>
      A grocery store is a retail establishment that sells food and household
      items, ranging from fresh produce to packaged goods. While the term
      "grocery store" is often used interchangeably with "supermarket" in some
      regions, particularly the US, "supermarket" refers to a larger store with
      a broader selection of both food and non-food products. Smaller, more
      specialized grocery stores can include "convenience stores" for
      essentials, "greengrocers" for fruits and vegetables, and "delicatessens"
      for prepared foods.
