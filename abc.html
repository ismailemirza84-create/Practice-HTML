    <h1>Welcome to the ABC Alphabets</h1>
    <h2>ABC is the Alphabets in English</h2>
    <p>
      An alphabet is a writing system where standard symbols, called letters,
      represent the distinct sounds (phonemes) of a language, allowing for the
      formation of words and sentences. The English alphabet, consisting of 26
      letters from A to Z, is a widely recognized example. Alphabets evolved
      from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and are a more efficient way to
      represent sounds compared to systems like syllabaries, which require
      symbols for each consonant-vowel combination.

        billion, and net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion.

        Cloud margin nearly doubles: Google Cloud's revenue surged 32%
        year-over-year to $13.6 billion, and operating income more than doubled.

        Significant increase in AI spending: Alphabet increased its 2025 capital
        expenditure forecast to $85 billion, a $10 billion jump from its
        previous estimate, to support the high demand for its cloud and AI
        services.
      </li>

        AI drives growth across the business: CEO Sundar Pichai stated that AI
        is positively impacting every part of the company. The Gemini AI app now
        has over 450 million monthly active users, and developers are
        increasingly building with Gemini.
      </li>
      <li>
        YouTube ad revenue beats expectations: YouTube's quarterly ad revenue
