    <h1>Box Model - Class Test</h1>
    <p>
      In HTML, the concept of a "box" primarily refers to two things: The CSS
      Box Model: This is a fundamental concept in CSS where every HTML element
      is treated as a rectangular box. This box consists of four main parts:
      Content: The actual content of the element (e.g., text, image). Padding:
      Space between the content and the border. Border: A visible line
      surrounding the padding and content. Margin: Space outside the border,
      separating the element from other elements. Understanding the box model is
      crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements on a webpage.
      Creating a Visual Box with HTML and CSS: While every element inherently
      has a box model, you often want to create distinct visual boxes for layout
      or content grouping. The primary way to achieve this is by using the
      element in HTML and then styling it with CSS. HTML Structure: You use the
      tag to create a container. For example: Code...
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML, the class attribute is used to define one or more class names for
      an element. These class names serve as identifiers that can be used by CSS
      and JavaScript to select and manipulate specific HTML elements. Here are
      the key aspects of the class attribute: Purpose: The primary purpose of
      the class attribute is to group elements together for styling or scripting
      purposes. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class name, allowing
      for consistent styling or behavior across them. Syntax: The class
      attribute is included within an HTML element's opening tag, followed by an
      equals sign and the class name(s) enclosed in double quotes..
