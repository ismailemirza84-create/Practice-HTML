 <h1>Dubai - United Arab Emirates</h1>
 <h2>General Information</h2>
 <p>Dubai - is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.[10] It is on a creek on the southeastern coast of the Persian Gulf. As of 2025, its population stands at 4 million,[7] 92% of whom are expatriates.[11] The wider urban area includes Sharjah and has a population of 5 million people as of 2023,[6] while the Dubai–Sharjah–Ajman metropolitan area counts 6 million inhabitants.</p>
 <h3>Historical Background</h3>
 <p>Founded in the early 18th century as a small fishing and pearling settlement, Dubai transformed into a regional trade center in the 20th century after declaring itself a free port in 1901. The discovery of oil in the 1960s significantly accelerated its development, leading to rapid urbanization and economic diversification. Today, oil contributes less than 1% to the emirate's GDP, with the economy now centered around trade, tourism, aviation, and real estate</p>
